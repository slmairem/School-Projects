# School-Projects  ||  All codes: Labwork, Assignments, Homeworks

It is some backup. 

I organized all my codes before pushing them to here.
Some of my codes didn't work correctly because I lacked knowledge then.
Used Codding Languages: C, C++, MIPS Assembly, MySQL

.pdsjr -> Circuits, you can open them with Logisim
